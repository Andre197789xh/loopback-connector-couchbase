The Couchbase Connector module for for [loopback-datasource-juggler](http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback-datasource-juggler/).


### What is Couchbase Server?
Couchbase Server is a NoSQL document database for interactive web applications. It has a flexible data model, is easily scalable, provides consistent high performance and is "always-on", meaning it can serve application data 24 hours, 7 days a week.


### What is N1QL?
N1QL (pronounced "Nickel") is a next generation query language for Couchbase Server. N1QL presents easy and familiar abstractions to quickly develop scalable applications that work with next generation database systems. It allows for joins, filter expressions, aggregate expressions and many other features to build a rich application. 


### Getting Started
Before installing the connector module, make sure you've taken the appropriate steps to install and configure Couchbase Server and the N1QL Engine.

* Download and install [Couchbase Server](http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads).
* After the install completes confirm the Couchbase Administrator is running at http://localhost:8091
* Download the [N1QL Binaries](http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads#PreRelease)


### N1QL Tutorial
N1QL has an interactive online tutorial and a N1QL cheatsheet. The online tutorial is a good way to get started and play with N1QL in an easy, fun environment. The cheatsheet is a quick glance and easy reference of the N1QL syntax. NOTE: Not all capabilities of the N1QL Engine are supported in this connector. For more information on N1QL, see:

* [N1QL Cheatsheet](http://docs.couchbase.com/files/Couchbase-N1QL-CheatSheet.pdf)
* [Couchbase Language Tutorial](http://query.pub.couchbase.com/tutorial/#1)


### Running N1QL
To run N1QL on your local system:

Step 1:  Expand the package archive.
Step 2:  On the command line, navigate to your local N1QL directory.
Step 3:  Run ./start_tutorial.sh (Unix)
             ./start_tutorial.bat (Windows)
Step 4:  Open http://localhost:8093/tutorial in your browser to use the tutorial on your local server.
       
To connect N1QL with your Couchbase Server:

    ./cbq-engine -couchbase http://[server_name]:8091/
  

To use the command-line interactive query tool:

    ./cbq-engine=http://[couchbase-query-engine-server-name]:8093/
  
   
Step 5: Before issuing queries against a Couchbase bucket, run the following command from the query command line:

    CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON [bucket-name]



### Installing the connector
```npm install couchbase```

```npm install loopback-connector-couchbase```


## Connector settings

The connector can be configured using the following settings from the data source.
* host  (default to 'localhost'): The host name or ip address of the Couchbase server
* port (default to 8091): The port number of the Couchbase server
* n1qlport (default to 8093): The port number of the N1QL Engine
* name (default to couchbase): The name of the datasource
* connectionTimeout (default to 20000): The connection timeout value
* operationTimeout (default to 15000): The operation timeout value
* env (default to debugging): Environment varialbe for debugging


## Model definition for Couchbase Document

**NOTE**: By default, all records will be created with a docType property which matches the model name.  Also, Id's are currently auto-generated by the connector.  These aspects are a work in progress and we would be interested in hearing other developer's use-cases so that we can improve the connector to be as flexible as possible.

The model definition consists of the following properties:

```json

  {
  "name": "Brewery",
  "base": "PersistedModel",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "type": "String",
      "id": true,
      "required": true,
      "index": true
    },
    "name": {
      "type": "String",
      "required": true
    }
  },
  "validations": [],
  "relations": {
    "actions": {
      "type": "hasMany",
      "model": "Beer",
      "foreignKey": "breweryId"
    }
  },
  "acls": [],
  "methods": []
}

```
